### About

This is a coding practice assignment completed during my data science training. 

### Assignment Instructions

Congratulations! After a lot of hard work in the data munging mines, you've landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. You've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.


**Observable Trends:**

* After comparing the purchasing data by age and gender, its clear the majority of players are male (84.03%) between the ages of 20-24.
 
* Male players have higher number of purchases, while female players and players who have not disclosed their gender spend more on each purchase.  Female players and non-disclosed players have a higher average purchase than that of all players.  Gaining more players that are female and non-disclosed will boost sales.

* Three of the most popular items to purchase (Item IDs: 92, 178, 145) are also on the list of most profitable items. Players are more likely to purchase items with greater value.
